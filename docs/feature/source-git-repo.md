# Source &mdash; git repository

[!NOTE] Status
Idea

Allow users to specify a particular git repository to be their source
of input for any information about ontologies, schema's and the like.

We could create a shallow bare clone of that repo, for caching purposes
and to provide fast access for various types of scans.

## RDF, OWL, SHACL, SKOS

Find any RDF files and try to document them.

## Non-RDF

Sky is the limit here. We could search for existing
documentation in the form of markdown, ascidoc, word etc.

We could scan for Excel spreadsheets and document them.

Erwin diagrams, UML, Mermaid, SQL schema, and so forth.

## License

Find the license and ownership info.

## Git log

Derive documentation from the git-log.
Contributors, change frequency, percentage contributed,
and so forth.
