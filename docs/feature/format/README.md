# Formats

Formats are the types of data that GraphArch can process.
Things to document can come from any number of sources providing
data in a variety of formats and structures.

1. [RDF File](../source/file/source-file-rdf.md)
1. [Markdown File](../source/file/source-file-markdown.md)
1. [git](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-git-repo.md)
1. [SPARQL](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-gsql.md)
1. [Cypher](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-cypher.md)
1. [GSQL](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-gsql.md)
1. [GraphQL](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-graphql.md)
1. [SQL](../source/endpoint/source-endpoint-sql.md)
1. ...

Obviously, the primary focus is on RDF data, either retrieved
via SPARQL queries or loaded from files in formats like
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
[RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-xml/),
[N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/),
[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/),
etc.

But other kinds of data could be supported as well, even
non-RDF files such as JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, TOML, Parquet,
again there's no limit, as long as someone writes a plugin
for it to support it.

1. [Markdown](../source/file/source-file-markdown.md)
1. [JSON](../source/file/source-file-json.md)
1. [CSV](../source/file/source-file-csv.md)
1. [XML](../source/file/source-file-xml.md)
1. [YAML](../source/file/source-file-yaml.md)
1. [TOML](../source/file/source-file-toml.md)
