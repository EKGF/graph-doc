# Source &mdash; GraphQL endpoint

[!NOTE] Status
Idea

Scan a given data source given a GraphQL endpoint.

- Although GraphQL &mdash; despite its name &mdash; does not really
  give access to a graph (at least not in the semantic tech sense nor
  in the LPG graph sense), we could still generate useful docs from it.
