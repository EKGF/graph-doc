# Source &mdash; SPARQL endpoint

[!NOTE] Status
Idea

Scan a given database, pointed to with a given SPARQL endpoint URL,
for things to document such as:

- OWL Ontologies
- SKOS Taxonomies
- SHACL Shapes

Or, find "annotations" that people left behind in the graph,
that instruct grapharch how to generate documentation.
