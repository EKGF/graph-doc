# Source &mdash; Markdown File

Process a given Markdown file.

- This is a simple plugin that will extract the title,
  description, and any other metadata from the file (or
  from the YAML front matter) and add it to the
  documentation model.
- It could also be a file being referred to by a link in
  some content derived by another source plugin and
  used as a text-fragment to be included in the documentation.
- YAML front matter may be used to provide specific information
  about the documentable item.
