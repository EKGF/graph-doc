# Formats

Formats are the types of data that GraphArch can process.
Things to document can come from any number of sources providing
data in a variety of formats, structures, and protocols.

1. [RDF File](../sources/files/rdf.md)
1. [Markdown File](../sources/files/markdown.md)
1. [JSON File](../sources/files/json.md)
1. [CSV File](../sources/files/csv.md)
1. [XML File](../sources/files/xml.md)
1. [YAML File](../sources/files/yaml.md)
1. [TOML File](../sources/files/toml.md)
1. [git](../sources/endpoints/git-repo.md)
1. [SPARQL](../sources/endpoints/sparql.md)
1. [Cypher](../sources/endpoints/cypher.md)
1. [GSQL](../sources/endpoints/gsql.md)
1. [GraphQL](../sources/endpoints/graphql.md)
1. [SQL](../sources/endpoints/sql.md)
1. ...

Obviously, the primary focus is on RDF data, either retrieved
via SPARQL queries or loaded from files in formats like
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
[RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-xml/),
[N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/),
[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/),
etc.

But other kinds of data could be supported as well, even
non-RDF files such as JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, TOML, Parquet,
again there's no limit, as long as someone writes a plugin
for it to support it.

1. [Markdown](../source/file/source-file-markdown.md)
1. [JSON](../source/file/source-file-json.md)
1. [CSV](../source/file/source-file-csv.md)
1. [XML](../source/file/source-file-xml.md)
1. [YAML](../source/file/source-file-yaml.md)
1. [TOML](../source/file/source-file-toml.md)
