## Conventional Commits

**Conventional Commits** is a specification for adding human and
machine-readable meaning to commit messages.
It is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history,
that can then be used to generate changelogs, upgrade notes, and more.

See [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more information.
